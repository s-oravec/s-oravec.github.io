So I begin with OpenSource. 3...2...1...NOW!!! Actually I did couple months ago, but sometimes it takes a longer time to publish something, than to do it.

I've developed a lot. I've deleted more code with backspace than some of my more senior colleagues have ever written.

There's only one catch. Almost all of it has been in PL/SQL or SQL\*Plus. It's ugly, but powerful. Even COBOL is more sexy than PL/SQL and programming in SQL\*Plus can be even worse than [this cutie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). But still it can be fun.

There was huge reinventing of wheel on almost every project I came to. And I've got tired of that.

I had a long pause in my PL/SQL programming quest and spent some time developing in JavaScript. And I found that hidden world of OpenSource software. And I was amazed and decided to share some of my knowledge.

So here's my contribution to my future self and to humanity - in PL/SQL and SQL\*Plus.

Enjoy. Comment. Fork. Post PRs. Any form of interaction is greatly welcomed.
